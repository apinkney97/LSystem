LSystem
=======

Viewer for Lindenmayer systems (in Fractint's format)


The class with the main method is LSystem; since it is in the package lsystem, it must be run in the format

 $ java lsystem.LSystem

when you are in the parent directory of lsystem.

Alternatively, compile it to a .jar file and just run that, which is probably easier.
NetBeans will probably do it for you.


L-Systems are specified within .l files. The program attempts to read any .l files in the base directory.

See Operators.txt for an overview of the drawing operators.

See http://www.nahee.com/spanky/www/fractint/lsys/tutor.html for full details of the format used by the .l files.
