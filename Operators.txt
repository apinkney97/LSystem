Drawing Operators:

F   Draw forward
G   Move forward
+   increase F/G angle by preset amount
-   decrease F/G angle by preset amount
|   turn F/G angle by 180 degrees (or as near as possible if angle is odd)

D   Draw forward
M   Move forward
\n  add n degrees to D/M angle
/n  subtract n degrees from D/M angle

!   reverse meaning of + and -, and \ and /

<n  cycle colour by n places down
>n  cycle colour by n places up
Cn  set colour to colour n

@n  scale current length by a factor of n

[   save the current graphics state
]   restore the most-recently saved graphics state

Notes:
All drawing commands are case-insensitive

[ and ] can be nested, and do not have to balance (although they probably should)

In all cases above, 'n' should be replaced by a valid representation of a number, eg
\31.4443
would add 31.4443 degrees to the angle used by the D and M operators

The number can be preceded by 'i' for its recIprocal ("Inverse"?), and/or 'q' for its sQuare root, eg
@iq2
would scale the current length by 1/sqrt(2).
i and q can be supplied in either order and are case-insensitive.

All other characters are ignored for the purposes of drawing, but may be used for string generation.
